A bunch of problems I encountered during the course Introduction to programming with C++ in the Sofia University Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics.


## Point in Grey area

Write a program **PointInGreyArea.cpp** that reads from the console two real numbers x and y. These numbers define a point in the two-dimensional space. The program should tell if the point is in the Grey area of the figure.

## Get previous date

Write a program **GetPreviousDate.cpp** that reads three integers from the console forming a date (dd/mm/yyyy). If the date is valid, print on the console the previous date in the same format. (Don't forget leap years!)

## Automorphic numbers

Write a program that reads from the console the integer n and after that prints the first n automorphic numbers.

Each positive number we call automorphic if it has it's square at the end of it.
Ex: 5( 2**5** ), 6( 3**6** ), 25( 6**25** )
