A bunch of problems I encountered during the course Introduction to programming with C++ in the Sofia University Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics.


## Point in Grey area

Write a program **PointInGreyArea.cpp** that reads from the console two real numbers x and y. These numbers define a point in the two-dimensional space. The program should tell if the point is in the Grey area of the figure.

## Get previous date

Write a program **GetPreviousDate.cpp** that reads three integers from the console forming a date (dd/mm/yyyy). If the date is valid, print on the console the previous date in the same format. (Don't forget leap years!)

## Automorphic numbers

Write a program **AutomorphicNumbers.cpp** that reads from the console the integer n and after that prints the first n automorphic numbers.

Each positive number we call automorphic if it has it's square at the end of it.
Ex: 5( 2**5** ), 6( 3**6** ), 25( 6**25** )

## Rhombus of numbers

Write a program **RhombusOfNumbers.cpp** that reads an integer n from the console and prints a Rhombus of numbers. First line should hold only the number n/2 and every next line should how two more till the middle part which should hold all the numbers from 1 to n. After that their count reduces by 2 each next line.

n = 2

..23..

1234

1234

..23..

n = 5

....3....

..234...

12345

..234..

....3....


## Prime sum of divisors

Write a program **PrimeSumOfDivisors.cpp** that reads from the console two integers n and m. The program should print on the screen the count of the numbers in the interval [n, m] which have prime sum of divisors.

Ex:

28 -> 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28

16 -> 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15 

## Pyramid of Pascal

Write a program **PyramidOfPascal.cpp** that reads an integer n from the console and prints the n-th layer of the Pyramid of Pascal.
